# DDM_without_baryons

* main.jl and myFunctions.jl are unmodified files from Jacky Yip (CUHK). They serve as a backup.
* mod_main.jl and mod_myFunctions are modified from their respective origins. They are altered to remove codes that contain Baryons and use integration over r instead of theta in the g function.
* PrintResult.py uses the data generated to compare the DM density profile obtained using NFW profile, Jacky's code and this modified code.
